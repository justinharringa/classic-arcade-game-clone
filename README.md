# Running the game
Simply open index.html up in a browser and you can use the arrow keys to 
move the player. When you reach the top with the player he'll respawn at 
the bottom to start again.

# Setup
I'm using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) to 
manage dependencies (which really only amount to build/TDD tools)
  
# Running Unit Tests
You can run `gulp test` to run the unit tests.

## TDD Mode
You can run `gulp tdd` to continuously run unit tests when project files change.
